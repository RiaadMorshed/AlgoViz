## Algorithms Implemented

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

## How to Use

1. Select an algorithm from home cards.
2. Click on the `Start Sorting` button to start the sort function.
3. Observe how the bars representing the array elements are rearranged step by step to achieve a sorted order.
4. You can restart the process by clicking on the `Reset` button.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`.
4. Open your browser and navigate to the specified local server address.

## Todo Features

- Generate array button to randomly generate array. The length of the array would be determined by browser window size.
- Ability to pause and resume the sorting function.
- Create a logo for this project.
- Showing the time taken by the sorting function
- Option for comparing two algorithms in real time and determining the winner.
