# Sorting Algorithm Visualization

This project is a web application that visualizes various sorting algorithms. It provides a visual representation of how different sorting algorithms work by animating the sorting process step by step.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- (Planned) Merge Sort
- (Planned) Quick Sort

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`.
4. Open your browser and navigate to the specified local server address.

## How to Use

1. Click on the "Generate New Array" button to generate a new random array.
2. Click on the respective sorting algorithm button to visualize the sorting process.
3. Observe how the bars representing the array elements are rearranged step by step to achieve a sorted order.

## Code Snippets

### Bubble Sort

```tsx
// ... (import statements and component setup)

const bubbleSort = async () => {
  // code will updated soon
};
```

### Selection Sort

```tsx
const selectionSort = async () => {
  // code will updated soon
};
```

### Insertion Sort

````tsx
// ... (import statements and component setup)

const insertionSort = async () => {
  // code will updated soon
} ```
````
